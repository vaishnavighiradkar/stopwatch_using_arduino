# Stopwatch Using Arduino

## Aim

To create a Stopwatch Using Arduino. 

## Purpose

To  learn how to create a stopwatch.

## Components Required

- Arduino Uno
- Push Buttons
- LCD 16*4
- wires 

## Short Description 

- I am using  a LCD to display time and two push buttons to start and pause the stop watch

## Workflow of the Project

- When the simulation is started, lcd will firstly display a message "Press the start".
- fter pressing the rightmost push button, the stopwatch will start. 
- We can pause it by pressing the another push button.

## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Setup a circuit as shown in the circuit diagram in images folder
- Write the code as given
- Start simulation
- Press the right push button to start the stopwatch
- To pause it, press another push button
- Observe the changes on lcd.
